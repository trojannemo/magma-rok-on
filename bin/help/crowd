Crowd audio is a special crowd track specific to a single song that plays alongside the generic crowd noises when the Performance Meter is very high

This is how most on-disc pre-RB3 songs have the crowd singing along when the player does well

If your Xbox 360 setup includes surround sound, the crowd audio will play through the rear speakers!
