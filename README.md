## ⚠️ Important

This repository contains **source code only**.

- Required runtime binaries are distributed under **Releases**
- See **BUILDING.md** for detailed compile instructions

If you plan to compile Magma without modifying the source code, you **must** download the contents of the `/bin/` and `/res/` folders and place them alongside the compiled executable.

These folders contain:
- Required dependencies
- Third-party tools
- Runtime assets Magma expects to access at launch

## About

This was **the** tool used to create **Rock Band 3 songs and customs**.

Through collective community effort and continued maintenance, **Magma: Rok On Edition** remains the *de facto* tool for authoring Rock Band 3 content — now with improvements and fixes that go well beyond the original release.

## Development Environment

- **Language:** C#  
- **Framework:** .NET Framework **4.8.1**  
- **IDE:** Visual Studio **2022 Community Edition**

For best results, use the same environment.
