# Magma: Rok On Edition
Developed by Harmonix Music Systems for use with the Rock Band Network<br>
Decompiled using JetBrains DotPeek and rebuilt in Visual Studio by Nemo in 2013<br>
Maintained by Nemo between 2013-2015<br>
[The Dark Ages] 2015-2019<br>
Maintained by FujiSkunk between 2019-2024<br>
And back to Nemo 2025-Present (as of this writing, January 28, 2025)<br>
<br>
This was literally the tool to create Rock Band 3 songs and customs. With our collective improvements it continues to be the de facto tool, but now it's even better.<br>
<br>
If you're going to just download and compile without much or any editing to the source code, please make sure to download everything in the /bin/ and /res/ folders and put it in the appropriate folders wherever your executable is. These are all the dependencies, third-party tools and assets Magma expects to have access to.
<br><br>
Magma is written in C# using .NET Framework 4.8.1 and using Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition. For best results make sure you use the same.

If you have technical questions or want to discuss Magma with me, I can be found in most Rock Band related Discord servers under the same username. Send me a message and let's talk.

Magma wouldn't be possible without the initial development by Harmonix, so many thanks to them for that and for creating this amazing music game franchise.
<br><br>But others helped make Magma: Rok On Edition what it is, and they deserve recognition and thanks, so let's get into it.
